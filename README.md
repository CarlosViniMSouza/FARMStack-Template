# [Introducing FARM Stack - FastAPI, React, and MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/python/farm-stack-fastapi-react-mongodb/)

As much as I enjoy working with React and Vue, Python is still my favourite language for building back end web services. I wanted the same benefits I got from **MERN — MongoDB**: *speed, flexibility, minimal boilerplate—but with Python instead of Node.js*. With that in mind, I want to introduce the [FARM stack; FastAPI, React, and MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/FARM-Intro).

## What is FastAPI?

The FARM stack is in many ways very similar to MERN. We've kept MongoDB and React, but we've replaced the Node.js and Express back end with Python and FastAPI.

[FastAPI is a modern, high-performance, Python 3.6+ web framework](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). As far as web frameworks go, it's incredibly new. The earliest git commit I could find is from December 5th, 2018, but it is a rising star in the Python community. It is already used in production by the likes of [Microsoft, Uber, and Netflix](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#opinions).

And it is [speedy](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#performance). Benchmarks show that it's not as fast as golang's chi or fasthttp, but it's faster than all the other Python frameworks tested and beats out most of the Node.js ones too.
